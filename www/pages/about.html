            Smart home technology promises tremendous benefits for elderly people living alone. A smart home could notify the resident when it's time to take medicine, 
            alert the hospital if the resident falls and track how much the resident is eating. If an elderly person is a little forgetful, the smart home could perform 
            tasks such as shutting off the water before a tub overflow or turning off the oven if the cook had wandered away. One builder estimates that a system like this 
            could cost $20,000, which is less expensive than a full-time nursing home [source: Venkatesh]. It also allows adult children who might live elsewhere to participate 
            in the care of their aging parent. Easy-to-control automated systems would provide similar benefits to those with disabilities or a limited range of movement.
